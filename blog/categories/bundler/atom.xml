    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been waiting for the 24th of February to see what would come of
the planned release date for Ruby 2.0.0-p0.</p>

<p>I wanted to apply my "Learn By Testing" repository on this new Ruby, and
am running into a few problems. <!-- more -->  The first was Bundler 1.3.0 needs to be
installed.  Simple enough to install.  Just go to the repository, clone
it,  select the tagged version, then install it locally as a gem.</p>

<p>Trying to use a Gemfile with Bundler though is giving me some errors.</p>

<p>See, I am using Guard and I wanted to add the <code>rb-inotify</code> gem to my
<code>Gemfile</code>.  But in doing so, I get this error:</p>

<p><code>``
~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/bundler-1.3.0.pre.8/lib/bundler/lazy_specification.rb:74:in</code>method_missing': LazySpecification has not been materialized yet (calling :required_ruby_version []) (RuntimeError)</p>

<pre><code>    from ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/bundler-1.3.0.pre.8/lib/bundler/match_platform.rb:11:in `match_platform'
    â€¦
    from ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/bin/ruby_noexec_wrapper:14:in `eval'
    from ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/bin/ruby_noexec_wrapper:14:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The problem is that in my RVM I had a bundler 1.2 version installed in
the @global gemset.</p>

<p>Removing the global bundler, making sure that Bundler 1.3.0 was
installed, seems to have corrected the issues.</p>

<p>Now on to write tests for Ruby 2.0 and absorb some knowledge while
recording what I have learned.</p>
