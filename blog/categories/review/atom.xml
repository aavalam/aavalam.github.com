    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A book(let) review.</p>

<p>A hands on guide for Ruby newbies to create and publish their first Ruby
gem.</p>

<p>Satish has published a booklet that takes you through the steps required
to publish your first Ruby Gem.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BECCKYM"><img class="right" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZtM8-8HNL.<em>BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-55,22_AA300_SH20_OU01</em>.jpg" width="300" height="300" title="How Do I Create And Publish My First Ruby Gem?" ></a> Recently updated with information on
how to 'yank' your gem in case you don't need it to be available, it is
a good short reference to get you quickly started in the world of Ruby Gems.</p>

<p>There are tools out there that do the work for you in terms of having a
skeleton.  This booklet will cover none of those.  It will take you
through the basics to get a gem up and running in a few short minutes.</p>

<p>Yes, all the information is available for free.  And it is not that
difficult to find it all.  But dropping a dollar to have a handy
reference on your Kindle to support Satish's efforts on RubyLearning is
just a small way to say "Thanks!" and a way to show some love.</p>
